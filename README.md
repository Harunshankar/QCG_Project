# Quantum Kernel SVM for Wine Dataset

This project implements a Quantum Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying the Wine dataset. The implementation uses quantum computing techniques to enhance the SVM kernel, potentially improving classification accuracy.

## Overview

The code provided demonstrates the following steps:
- Loading and preprocessing the Wine dataset.
- Defining a quantum feature map and variational circuit using PennyLane.
- Computing the quantum-enhanced kernel matrix for SVM.
- Optimizing quantum parameters to maximize kernel-target alignment.
- Training a classical SVM using the optimized quantum kernel matrix.
- Visualizing the SVM decision boundary on a 2D plot.
- Evaluating the classifier's accuracy on the test set.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`
- `pennylane`
- `scipy`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn joblib pennylane scipy
